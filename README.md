## Adobe Captivate for Beginners

Captivate is a versatile and powerful tool but it has some idiosyncracies that can be quite disruptive and even infuriating if you're not aware of them. These tips will help you avoid the most common pitfalls.


### Top Recommendations

1. Avoid the responsive templates
2. Set up your development environment with visible properties pane and timeline
3. Create at least one master slide with pause button
4. Hide the playbar if using custom navigation and/or during quiz

### Quizzes

1. Don't try to alter the question or review slides much -- many changes you make in design view will be overridden
2. To see what you can change, use Quiz Settings
3. If you don't like the available options, build your own quiz/game/interaction using advanced actions and variables

### Troubleshooting

1. If something goes wrong and you don't understand why, it is likely a result of the timeline
2. Common timing problems = slide is too short (advances before finished), shapes disappear, buttons go inactive
2. Preview in the browser (Captivate preview often won't turn up bugs)

### Publishing

1. Check HTML5 tracker before publishing
2. Publish to HTML5 not Flash 
3. Check box for scalable HTML
4. Publish to zip file

### Hosting

1. Easily host your projects for free at https://000webhost.com
2. Upload project zip file to public html folder (Upload Files from dashboard)
3. Right click and extract zip file to new folder (use project name) 
4. Open folder, right click on index.html and view to get URL
5. Can host multiple projects on a single site
